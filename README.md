Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)

- Addressing the combined problem of trajectory planning and tracking control for under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle(AUV). 
- Formulated the kinematics and dynamics equations for the above system.
- Worked on designing a Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) controller, which aims at tracking a series of way-points which operator registers arbitrarily in advance.
- Employed MATLAB software to carry out simulations.
